# Introduction

The FactoMineR package is a package dedicated to exploratory multivariate data analysis using R. 
One of the main reasons for developing this package is that we felt a need for a multivariate
approach closer to our practice via:
* the introduction of ``supplementary'' information;
* the use of a more geometrical point of view than the one
usually adopted by most of the Anglo-American practitioners.
Another reason is that obviously it represents a convenient way to
implement new methodologies (or methodologies dedicated to the
advanced practitioner) as the ones we're presenting thereafter
that take into account different structure on the data such as:
* a partition on the variables;
* a partition on the individuals;
* a hierarchy structure on the variables.

You can see more information about the package with the paper published in 
the Journal of Statistical Software:
